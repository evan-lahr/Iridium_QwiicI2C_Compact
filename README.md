Ultra-compact Qwiic (I²C) breakout for the Iridium 9603/9603N satellite modem (e.g., https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic-iridium-9603n.html
). Built for space-constrained deployments, it integrates I²C control, power regulation, and modem support circuitry in a footprint only slightly larger than the 9603N itself—ideal for embedded field systems.
