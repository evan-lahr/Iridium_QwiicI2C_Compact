Ultra-compact Qwiic-based breakout for the Iridium 9603/9603N satellite modem (e.g., https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic-iridium-9603n.html). Designed for space-constrained deployments, this unit provides I²C control, power regulation and modem support circuitry in a minimal footprint—ideal for embedded field systems.
